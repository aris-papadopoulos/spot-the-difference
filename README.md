# Spot the difference

**A "Spot the difference" mini-game using HTML, CSS and JS.**

This game was initially started in order to learn more about events on certain screen coordinates using Javascript & Jquery.
The basic functionality of the game works, as well as some extras (lives, score counting, special abilities). 
But it's still unfinished, as it yet needs the game sessions mechanics to be defined, and photos to be added.
